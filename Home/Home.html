		<h1>Welcome to Isaac's Arcade!</h1>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, and welcome to Isaac's Arcade! My name is Isaac Chen, and I am <span id="ageText">the creator of this site</span>.
			I have a huge passion for computer programming, and decided to make a website with all my games and projects.
			It turned out pretty cool in my <em>completely unbiased</em> opinion, but storage limitations forced me to switch website hosts.
			I figured that was as good a time as any to give the site a <span class="newLook"></span> I'm (obviously) not a graphic designer,
			but I do think this new site looks a *little* better than <a href="../Old site/index.html" class="subtleLink">the old one</a>.
			I hope you agree :)
